# search-filter
Search on the web has gone far beyond simply going to search engines to find information. In order to dig deeper and find content more relevant to search queries, website visitors are increasingly searching through actual websites themselves for that right piece of content they're looking for. To take that a step further, it is possible to add filters to your search inputs so your website visitors can further specify the content they are looking for. This allows you to deliver a better web experience that provides the visitor with the content they are looking for at a much faster rate.  In this tutorial, we will teach you how to add a category filter to your search input to provide more relevant search results to website visitors.
